# SolBlaze flux - Clean The Network

**A public good initiative by SolanaHub to strengthen the Solana network through intelligent validator selection.**

SolBlaze flux is a web application that helps Solana stakers identify poorly performing validators and seamlessly migrate their stake to high-quality, trusted validators. By improving validator selection across the network, we enhance Solana's security, performance, and decentralization for everyone.

## What This App Does

- **üîç Validator Analysis**: Automatically scans your existing stake accounts and identifies validators that may be harming network performance
- **‚ö° Smart Migration**: Provides one-click delegation to vetted, high-performing validators through the SolBlaze liquid staking protocol  
- **üíß Liquid Staking**: Receive bSOL tokens representing your stake, which you can use in DeFi while earning staking rewards
- **üõ°Ô∏è Network Protection**: Help strengthen Solana by reducing stake concentration among poor validators
- **üìä Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous validator performance tracking and recommendations

## Mission: Public Good

This application was built by **SolanaHub** as a **public good initiative** to address a critical challenge facing the Solana network: the concentration of stake among validators that may compromise network performance and security. 

By making it easy for everyday users to identify and migrate away from problematic validators, we're working to:
- Improve overall network performance and reliability
- Enhance decentralization by better distributing stake
- Protect users from validator-related risks
- Strengthen Solana's long-term sustainability

*This tool is provided free of charge to the Solana community with no profit motive - only the goal of making the network better for everyone.*
